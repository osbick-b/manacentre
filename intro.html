					Most of us are born with
					<strong>intuitive skills</strong> but nobody teaches us how
					to own them. In fact, as we learn to
					<strong>grow submissive, docile and fearful,</strong> we are
					taught by a patriachal system to
					<strong>repress our innate powers</strong>.

						If you are looking to connect to your
						<strong>intuition with confidence</strong> even though
						you know nothing about spirituality...

						If you're seeking to
						<strong>improve the quality</strong> of your
						relationships without losing yourself in the process...

					My Tarot reading has a therapeutic approach with sparkles of
					divination. That means,
					<strong>I honour you as the protagonist of your life</strong
					>, with agency on your destiny and I refuse to place you as
					a mere object of it. Tarot has no power to change your life
					if you don't take the steps to make the necessary
					adjustments. But it has the power to
					<strong>show us the ways to a prosper life!</strong>
				</p>
				<p class="normal">
					This course is designed to give you
					<strong>solid basis</strong> for you to build your Tarot
					practice on.
					<strong
						>I'll give you all you need to read for yourself and for
						others</strong
					>.

				<p class="sidenote">
					Experience with Tarot is welcome, but not required!
