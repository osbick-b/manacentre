				<p class="normal centered">
					I am a professional Tarot reader for
					<strong>10 years</strong> and in the last
					<strong>3 years</strong> I have taught
					<strong>7 classes</strong> of
					<strong>THE UNIVERSE OF THE TAROT</strong>. I am a
					practitioner of contemporary alternative therapies, a
					capacitor of psychic development and Apometry and priestess
					of traditional practices.
				</p>
				<p class="normal centered">
					My work is entirely devoted to
					<strong
						>increasing women's awareness of their personal
						potency</strong
					>
					and
					<strong
						>enabling healing by promoting their connection to the
						divine</strong
					>.
				</p>
				<p class="normal centered">
					My mission is to
					<strong
						>hold space and capacitate women to ground in their
						self-empowerment</strong
					>
					and <strong>hone in their sense of self-direction</strong>,
					firmly secure by a spiritual backing and truth.
